# ros_chrono
A HMMWV vehicle model developed in Project `Chrono` is controlled using `ROS` parameters by 4 different modes, which are described below.

## Mode 1: dynamic path following
In this mode, the HMMWV vehicle receives dynamic paths and follows it by PID controller.
To run the HMMWV vehicle using this mode, use the ROS node ‘path_following’.

```
rosrun ros_chrono path_following
```

### Input
These x-y trajectories obtained from external planners are used to generate a path for the `Chrono` vehicle to follow. For the standalone path follower demo, `planner_namespace = default`.

Name | Description
--- | ---
`system/planner/` | planner namespace specifying source of target x-y trajectories
`/state/chrono/planner_namespace/traj/x`| global x position trajectory (m)
`/state/chrono/planner_namespace/traj/yVal`| global y position trajectory (m)

### Output
If an actual vehicle is used or an external model of the vehicle is used, `/nloptcontrol_planner/flags/3DOF_plant` should be set to `false`. And the following `rosparam` states (points) should be set:

Name | Description
--- | ---
`/state/chrono/t`| simulation time (s)
`/state/chrono/x`| global x position (m)
`/state/chrono/yVal`| global y position (m)
`/state/chrono/psi`| global heading angle (rad)
`/state/chrono/theta`| global pitch angle (rad)
`/state/chrono/phi`| global roll angle (rad)
`/state/chrono/ux`| velocity in the x direction (vehicle frame) in (m/s)
`/state/chrono/v`| velocity in the y direction (vehicle frame) in (m/s)
`/state/chrono/ax`| acceleration in the x direction (vehicle frame) in (m/s^s)
`/state/chrono/r`| yaw rate about the z direction in (rad/s)
`/state/chrono/sa`| steering angle at the tire (rad)
`/state/chrono/control/thr`| Throttle control input mapped from [0 1]
`/state/chrono/control/brk`| Braking control input mapped from [0 1]
`/state/chrono/control/str`| Steering control input mapped from [-1 1]

To view states updating while `Chrono` is running, open another terminal and type:

```
$ rostopic echo vehicleinfo

```
This displays all states and inputs specified in the `veh_status.msg` file.

### Notes

## Mode 2: dynamic steering trajectory following
In Mode 2, this node `steering_controller` can simulate the vehicle’s motion at the control of varying steering input. In this test, both steering and velocity command are hardcoded.

To run the HMMWV vehicle using this mode, use the ROS node ‘steering_controller’.

```
rosrun ros_chrono steering_controller
```

### Input
These steering angles obtained from external planners are used to as an input for the `Chrono` vehicle to follow. For the standalone path follower demo, `planner_namespace = default`.

Name | Description
--- | ---
`planner_namespace/control/vx`| longitudinal velocity (m/s)
`planner_namespace/control/sa`| local steering angle (rad/s)

### Output
If an actual vehicle is used or an external model of the vehicle is used, `/nloptcontrol_planner/flags/3DOF_plant` should be set to `false`. And the following `rosparam` states (points) should be set:

Name | Description
--- | ---

## Mode 3: dynamic speed trajectory following
In Mode 3, this node `velocity_controller` can simulate the vehicle’s motion at the control of varying velocity. In this test velocity command is hardcoded.

To run the HMMWV vehicle using this mode, use the ROS node ‘velocity_controller’.

## OLD (below this)
A vehicle model in `Chrono` that can be used through `ROS`.

The vehicle model currently runs with rigid tire models, a rear-wheel driveline, double wishbone suspension (reduced so that the control arm positions are distance constraints), and rack and pinion steering.

## To run
```
$ cd $HOME/MAVs/ros
$ roslaunch ros_chrono demo.launch
$ rosparam set system/default/flags/initialized true
```

## Expected Output
![link](images/expectedoutputchronodemo.png)


## To run velocity test
Velocity test shows the ability of chorono to exchange information with ros.
```
$ roslaunch ros_chrono demo_velocity_control.launch
```
## Expected Output
![link](images/demo_velocity_control.png)
=======

## To run steering tracking test
steering tracking test shows the ability of chorono to exchange information with ros.
```
$ cd $HOME/MAVs/ros
$ roslaunch ros_chrono steering.launch
```
## Expected Output
![link](images/demo_steering.png)
Under a constant speed, the vehicle will be controlled by the steering angle command to follow the steering angle trajectory.


## Miscellaneous notes (may be outdated!)
### Change Vehicle Initial Conditions
To change initial trajectory edit the parameters in the `hmmwv_chrono_params.yaml` config file.

```
$ sudo gedit ros/src/system/config/s1.yaml

```
To change target speed, edit:

```
$ sudo gedit ros/src/models/chrono/ros_chrono/config/hmmwv_params.yaml
```
### Change Values of Updated Path
For the path_follower demo, update the parameters of `/state/chrono/default/traj/yVal`, `/state/chrono/default/traj/x` in hmmwv_chrono_params.yaml. Change the system/planner parameter to chrono in chrono.yaml. In general, set system/planner to desired planner and update state/chrono/ <planner_name> /traj/x, vehicle/chrono/ <planner_name> /traj/yVal.
